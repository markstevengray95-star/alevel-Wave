      title:"Deep dive: progressive waves, phase and wave motion",
      overview:"This section develops the wave language that every later Waves question relies on. The emphasis is on separating the motion of the medium from the motion of the disturbance, using phase precisely, and moving confidently between graphical, verbal and mathematical descriptions.",
      sections:[
        {h:"1. What actually travels in a wave?",p:"A progressive wave is a disturbance that transfers energy and information from one place to another. In a mechanical wave, particles of the medium oscillate around fixed equilibrium positions. They do not drift along with the wave in the ideal model. The wave pattern can move a large distance even though each particle only moves through a small displacement about equilibrium. This distinction is important in explanations: wave speed is the speed of propagation of a point of constant phase, not the instantaneous speed of an individual particle."},
        {h:"2. Displacement–distance and displacement–time graphs",p:"A displacement–distance graph is a snapshot of the whole wave at one instant. From it you can read amplitude, wavelength and phase separation between positions. A displacement–time graph follows one position as time passes. From it you can read amplitude, period and frequency. The two graph types can look similar but the horizontal axis represents different physical quantities, so a wavelength cannot be read from a time graph and a period cannot be read from a distance graph."},
        {h:"3. Frequency, period, wavelength and speed",p:"Frequency f is the number of complete oscillations per second, measured in hertz. Period T is the time for one complete oscillation, so f=1/T. Wavelength λ is the shortest distance between two points that are in the same phase. During one period, a progressive wave travels one wavelength. Therefore wave speed is v=λ/T=fλ. This relationship is valid for all periodic waves when v is the propagation speed in the medium."},
        {h:"4. Phase and phase difference",p:"Phase identifies the stage of an oscillation. Two points are in phase when they have the same displacement from equilibrium and are moving in the same direction. A full cycle corresponds to 360° or 2π radians. A separation of λ/4 corresponds to 90° or π/2 rad; λ/2 corresponds to 180° or π rad; λ corresponds to 360° or 2π rad. For a sinusoidal wave, Δφ=2πΔx/λ and also Δφ=2πΔt/T."},
        {h:"5. What changes at a boundary?",p:"When a wave crosses into another medium, the source still sets the frequency, so frequency remains constant at the boundary. If the propagation speed changes, the wavelength must change because v=fλ. This is the conceptual basis of refraction. Students often incorrectly state that frequency changes because wavelength changes; the correct chain is that the medium changes speed, the source fixes frequency, and wavelength adjusts."},
        {h:"6. Phase speed versus particle motion",p:"On a transverse wave, a marked point of the medium can be moving downward while the wave travels to the right. The direction of particle motion therefore cannot be inferred simply from the direction of propagation. To determine the local particle motion on a travelling sinusoidal wave, compare the local slope of a displacement–distance graph with the direction in which the whole pattern moves."}

Their electric and magnetic fields oscillate at right angles to the direction of travel."},
        {h:"2. Longitudinal waves",p:"In a longitudinal wave, oscillations are parallel to the direction of propagation. Sound in air is the standard example. Air molecules oscillate backwards and forwards and create alternating compressions and rarefactions. A compression is a region of greater pressure and density; a rarefaction is a region of lower pressure and density."},

A longitudinal wave is frequently drawn as crowded and spread-out particles, or using a graph of pressure/displacement against position. A sinusoidal graph for sound is therefore a graph of a varying physical quantity, not a literal picture of the air path."},
        {h:"4. Polarisation",p:"Plane polarisation restricts the oscillation of a transverse wave to one direction in the plane perpendicular to propagation. Because a longitudinal oscillation is already parallel to propagation, it cannot be plane-polarised in the same way. Observing polarisation is therefore evidence that a wave has a transverse nature."},

      sections:[
        {h:"1. Principle of superposition",p:"When waves overlap, the resultant displacement at each point is the algebraic/vector sum of the individual displacements. Superposition is instantaneous: each wave continues after overlap in an ideal linear medium. Constructive interference occurs when contributions reinforce; destructive interference occurs when they oppose."},
        {h:"2. Formation of a stationary wave",p:"A stationary wave can form when two waves of the same frequency travel in opposite directions and superpose. On a string, one wave is often the incident wave and the other is its reflection. At positions where the two waves are always in antiphase, a node forms. At positions where their displacements repeatedly reinforce, an antinode forms."},

Adjacent nodes are separated by λ/2. A node and its nearest antinode are separated by λ/4. The particles between adjacent nodes oscillate approximately in phase, while particles in neighbouring loops oscillate in antiphase."},
        {h:"4. Progressive versus stationary waves",p:"A progressive wave transfers energy through the medium and has the same amplitude at different positions in an ideal uniform medium. A stationary wave has position-dependent amplitude: zero at nodes and maximum at antinodes. There is no net transport of energy along an ideal stationary pattern because equal waves transport energy in opposite directions."},
        {h:"5. Harmonics on a string fixed at both ends",p:"The fixed ends must be nodes, so only wavelengths that fit an integer number of half-wavelengths into the length L are allowed. Hence L=nλ/2 and λn=2L/n. Combining this with v=fλ gives fn=nv/(2L). The first allowed mode is the first harmonic; AQA uses harmonic language rather than the terms fundamental/overtone in this section."},
        {h:"6. Wave speed on a stretched string",p:"For an ideal stretched string, v=√(T/μ), where T is tension and μ is mass per unit length. Increasing tension raises wave speed and therefore raises resonant frequencies. Increasing μ lowers wave speed and resonant frequencies. Combining the relationships gives fn=n/(2L)√(T/μ)."},

Away from resonance, reflections still occur but the stable high-amplitude mode is not strongly established. In practical work the resonant frequency is identified by a clear, stable pattern with large antinodes."},

A vibration generator or other driver produces waves on a stretched string. A clear resonant stationary pattern is identified using nodes and antinodes."},
        {h:"2. RP1 — changing length",p:"For a fixed harmonic with T and μ constant, f∝1/L. A plot of f against 1/L should therefore be linear. The vibrating length should be measured between the effective fixed points/nodes rather than from arbitrary apparatus edges."},
        {h:"3. RP1 — changing tension",p:"For fixed L, μ and harmonic, f∝√T, so f²∝T. Tension may be produced using a hanging mass, with the approximation T≈mg when pulley friction and acceleration are negligible. A graph of f² against T is a useful linearisation."},
        {h:"4. RP1 — changing mass per unit length",p:"For fixed L, T and harmonic, f∝1/√μ. Mass per unit length can be obtained from the mass and measured length of a sample of the string. Keeping the same material but changing thickness changes μ and therefore the wave speed."},
        {h:"5. RP1 — controlling the harmonic",p:"The mode number must remain controlled when investigating a single proportional relationship. Accidentally switching from one harmonic to another changes the wavelength condition and invalidates a simple f versus 1/L or f² versus T comparison."},
        {h:"6. Required Practical 2 — Young’s slits",p:"Use a monochromatic light source, double slit and screen to observe interference. Measure a distance spanning several fringe spacings and divide by the number of spacings. Then use w=λD/s. Laser safety must follow the school’s approved setup and teacher instructions; never look into the beam."},
        {h:"7. Required Practical 2 — diffraction grating",p:"For a known grating spacing, measure the angle of a principal maximum and use d sinθ=nλ. Measurements on both sides of the central maximum can be compared or averaged to reduce alignment effects. The physical order must satisfy nλ≤d."},
        {h:"8. Random and systematic uncertainty",p:"Repeated measurements reveal scatter and help estimate random uncertainty. Repeats do not remove a systematic error such as a zero offset or persistent misalignment. An improvement should target the named source of uncertainty rather than being a generic instruction to repeat more times."},
        {h:"9. Percentage uncertainty",p:"For a directly measured quantity x with absolute uncertainty u, percentage uncertainty is 100u/x. When a measured interval is small, measuring multiple intervals at once can reduce percentage uncertainty. For example, measuring ten fringe spacings gives a larger total distance while the ruler resolution stays similar."},
        {h:"10. Graphs and gradients",p:"Choose axes that test the predicted relationship. A straight graph supports a proportional model only if the transformed variables are appropriate. The gradient should be linked back to the theoretical equation, with units. A non-zero intercept may indicate systematic error or an unmodelled effect."}
