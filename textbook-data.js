      {h:"What a progressive wave is",p:"A progressive wave is a travelling disturbance that transfers energy from one place to another. In a mechanical wave, particles of the medium oscillate about equilibrium positions; the particles do not travel with the wave overall. Electromagnetic waves do not require a material medium."},
      {h:"Wave quantities",p:"Amplitude A is the maximum displacement from equilibrium. Wavelength λ is the shortest distance between two points in the same phase. Frequency f is the number of complete oscillations per second. Period T is the time for one complete oscillation. Wave speed v is the speed at which a point of constant phase moves through space.",eq:["f = 1/T","v = fλ"]},
      {h:"Phase",p:"Phase describes the stage of an oscillation. Two points are in phase if they have the same displacement and move in the same direction. One complete cycle is 360° or 2π rad. A separation Δx along a sinusoidal wave corresponds to a phase difference 2πΔx/λ. A time delay Δt corresponds to 2πΔt/T.",eq:["Δφ = 2π(Δx/λ)","Δφ = 2π(Δt/T)"]},
      {h:"Changing medium",p:"The source fixes the frequency. When a wave crosses a boundary into a medium in which its speed changes, its frequency stays constant, so its wavelength changes according to v = fλ."}

      {h:"Transverse waves",p:"In a transverse wave the oscillation is perpendicular to the direction of energy propagation. Waves on a stretched string and all electromagnetic waves are transverse. For an electromagnetic wave, electric and magnetic fields oscillate perpendicular to the direction of travel."},
      {h:"Longitudinal waves",p:"In a longitudinal wave the oscillation is parallel to the direction of propagation. Sound in air is a key example. Regions of compression have particles closer together and higher pressure; rarefactions have particles farther apart and lower pressure."},

      {h:"Polarisation",p:"A polariser restricts a transverse oscillation to one plane. The ability to polarise electromagnetic waves is evidence that they are transverse. Longitudinal waves cannot be plane-polarised in the same way because their oscillations are along the direction of travel."},
      {h:"Applications",p:"Polaroid filters can reduce glare and select an orientation of light. Radio or microwave transmission is strongest when the receiving aerial is aligned with the transmitted electric-field polarisation. AQA requires the qualitative behaviour here; Malus's law is not required."}

The central maximum becomes wider when wavelength increases or slit width decreases. AQA requires a qualitative treatment of this width variation; an intensity-versus-angle graph is not required."},
